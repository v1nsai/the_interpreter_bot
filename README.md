# The Interpreter: A Telegram Bot

Huge credit and thanks goes out to everyone at [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) for
making a Telegram bot wrapper that I could not refuse

In order to get this working you'll need to point the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable and bot_token local variable to
the files containing the keys.  The bot_token file is just a text file containing The Interpreter's API key, and more instructions for
setting up the Google Translate API key [can be found here.](https://cloud.google.com/translate/)
